# Prima Latina

- we are using the classical pronunciation because that's what we learned in school. 
Doing so required me to mark up my book with macrons to indicate vowel quantity.  I copied 
these to the files under `vowel_quantities`.  There may be mistakes, and I only indicate
quantity in stems, not suffixes.
- when introducing prepositions in lesson 12, I went ahead and gave a small introduction to case marking:
  - I said that _inter_, _suprā_ , and _contrā_ are _am_/_ās_ prepositions and _sub_ and _ex_ are _ā_/_īs_ prepositions.
     They seemed to have no difficulty learning this pattern.  I didn't use the terms ablative or accusative yet, or touch
     on how the same preposition can take different cases with different meanings.
