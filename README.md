# homeschooling

In this repository I will put anything I make while homeschooling my kids which seems potentially useful to others. I also, I have no idea if anything we are doing is a good idea at all, but I figured I would document it in case it turns out to work, for use with my younger kids when the time comes even if it benefits no one else.

## Math

We started off using [CSMP][csmp], but now use Stanley Schmidt's outstanding [_Life With Fred_][fred] almost exclusively.  We currently do one chapter of Fred each day in the morning.  I love it, my kids love it.  

## Science
We used Bernard Nebel's [_Building Foundations of Scientific Understanding: A Science Curriculum for K-2_][nebel].  We sprinkle this in at the rate of one lesson every week or two and try to reinforce its ideas in the course of daily life.

## Latin

I took a semester of intensive Latin (4 normal semesters crammed into one, an hour a day for a semster) in college but forgot almost all of it, so I am relearning it alongside the kids.  So beware you may find mistakes here.  

Currently one just have one kid, X, in school, but a second Y, listens along and picks some things up.  Our routine is as follows:
- each morning:
  - do a chapter of Johann Comenius's _Orbis Sensualium Pictus_ ([printed copy][comenius] from LuLu in conjunction with [Evan der Milner's videos][derMilner]).  Mr. der Milner says a phrase in Latin, then in English; I do the same; then X does.  This is very popular with the kids (who have made a song out of parts of the alphabet in chapter 1).
  - practice vocabulary from Memoria Press's [Prima Latina][primaLatina].  We typically do a spaced-repetition drill until X has gotten them all correct.  We usually get through two lessons per week.
- each afternoon:
  - X does one round of flash cards and one round of "matching" for the Prima Latina vocab on a Kindle tablet. X is otherwise not really allowed to use computers or tablets yet, so this is more a treat for him than a chore.

I am making notes on anywhere I diverge significantly from Memoria Press's curriculum in the file `latin/divergences.md`.  

## Catechism

We don't have a formal curriculum for this; mostly doing it ad-hoc as feasts of the Church year, etc. come up.  Some useful books:
  - Enid Chadwick's [_My Book of the Church Year_][enid]
  - [_Saints in Art_][saints]; [_Gospel Figures in Art_][art] (Guide to Imagery Series)
  - [The Little Oratory: A Beginner's Guide to Praying in the Home][oratory] by Leila Lawler and David Clayton.

## Reading

As preparation we taught sight words and letter sounds while reading books to X for about a year before he started to read.  When we were ready for formal teaching, we used Memoria Press's [First Start Reading][firstStart] together with the colored Primary Phonics readers (not published by MP but available from them).  It worked.  We didn't end up using Classical Phonics directly (which is also part of the MP curriculum) but my wife found it helpful (I have an undergrad degree in linguistics, so I didn't really need it).

Now that he reads well we use the grade-level books in the Memoria Press curriculum as a baseline and add more to supplement.  We also use MP's spelling curriculum intermittently.

## General
- [Worksheet Works][http://www.worksheetworks.com/] can make all sorts of worksheets for drilling math, Latin, etc.  We don't do a lot of drilling, but occassionally it's necessary.
