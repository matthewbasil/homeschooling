# homeschooling

In this repository I will put anything I make while homeschooling my kids which seems potentially useful to others.  

## Math

We started off using [CSMP][csmp], but now use Stanley Schmidt's outstanding [_Life With Fred_][fred] almost exclusively.  We currently do one chapter of Fred each day in the morning.  I love it, my kids love it.  

## Science
We used Bernard Nebel's [_Building Foundations of Scientific Understanding: A Science Curriculum for K-2][nebel].  We sprinkle this in at the rate of one lesson every week or two and try to reinforce its ideas in the course of daily life.

## Latin

I took a semester of intensive Latin (4 normal semesters crammed into one, an hour a day for a semster) in college but forgot almost all of it, so I am relearning it alongside the kids.  But beware you may find mistakes here.  I also, I have no idea if anything we are doing is a good idea at all, but I figured I would document it in case it turns out to work, for use with my younger kids when the time comes if nothing else.

Currently one just have one kid, X, in school, but a second Y, listens along and picks some things up.  Our routine is as follows:
- each morning:
  - do a chapter of Johann Comenius's _Orbis Sensualium Pictus_ ([printed copy][comenius] from LuLu in conjunction with [Evan der Milner's videos][derMilner]).  Mr. der Milner says a phrase in Latin, then in English; I do the same; then the kid does.  This is very popular with the kids.
  - practice vocabulary from Memoria Press's [Prima Latina][primaLatina].  We typically do a spaced-repetition drill until X has gotten them all correct.  We usually get through two lessons per week.
- each afternoon:
  - X does one round of flash cards and one round of "matching" for the Prima Latina vocab on a Kindle tablet. X is otherwise not really allowed to use computers or tablets yet, so this is more a treat for him than a chore.

I am making notes on anywhere I diverge significantly from Memoria Press's curriculum in the file `latin/divergences.md`.
