  "body": "On this site I will put anything I make while homeschooling my kids which seems potentially useful to others. I also, I have no idea if anything we are doing is a good idea at all, but I figured I would document it in case it turns out to work, for use with my younger kids when the time comes even if it benefits no one else.\r\n\r\n## Math\r\n\r\nWe started off using [CSMP][csmp], but now use Stanley Schmidt's outstanding [_Life With Fred_][fred] almost exclusively.  We currently do one chapter of Fred each day in the morning.  I love it, my kids love it.  \r\n\r\n## Science\r\nWe used Bernard Nebel's [_Building Foundations of Scientific Understanding: A Science Curriculum for K-2_][nebel].  We sprinkle this in at the rate of one lesson about every three weeks and try to reinforce its ideas in the course of daily life.\r\n\r\n## Latin\r\n\r\nI took a semester of intensive Latin (4 normal semesters crammed into one, an hour a day for a semster) in college but forgot almost all of it, so I am relearning it alongside the kids.  So beware you may find mistakes here.  \r\n\r\nCurrently one just have one kid, X, in school, but a second Y, listens along and picks some things up.  Initially our routine was follows:\r\n- each morning:\r\n  - do a chapter of Johann Comenius's _Orbis Sensualium Pictus_ ([printed copy][comenius] from LuLu in conjunction with [Evan der Milner's videos][derMilner]).  Mr. der Milner says a phrase in Latin, then in English; I do the same; then X does.  This is very popular with the kids (who have made a song out of parts of the alphabet in chapter 1).\r\n  - practice vocabulary from Memoria Press's [Prima Latina][primaLatina].  We typically do a spaced-repetition drill until X has gotten them all correct.  We usually get through two lessons per week.\r\n- each afternoon:\r\n  - X does one round of flash cards and one round of \"matching\" for the Prima Latina vocab on a Kindle tablet. X is otherwise not really allowed to use computers or tablets yet, so this is more a treat for him than a chore. (*note*: this has been partially replaced by Anki, see below)\r\n\r\nI was making notes on anywhere I diverge significantly from Memoria Press's curriculum in the file `latin/divergences.md`.  \r\n\r\nAfter completing MP's _Prima Latina_ and doing the first couple of chapters of _Latina Christiana_ we switched to using Hans Ã˜rberg's [_Lingua Latina: Per Se Illustrata_][linguaLatina].  We do one or two paragraphs per day depending in length and difficulty.  I read it aloud a sentence at a time (or a clause at time for long sentences) and X translates.  We are finishing chapter 2, so the jury is still out on how effective it will be.  So far, though, I prefer it to the MP curriculum.\r\n\r\n## Catechism\r\n\r\nWe don't have a formal curriculum for this; mostly doing it ad-hoc as feasts of the Church year, etc. come up.  Some useful books:\r\n  - Enid Chadwick's [_My Book of the Church Year_][enid]\r\n  - [_Saints in Art_][saints]; [_Gospel Figures in Art_][art] (Guide to Imagery Series)\r\n  - [The Little Oratory: A Beginner's Guide to Praying in the Home][oratory] by Leila Lawler and David Clayton.\r\n\r\nWe try (emphsis on _try_) to do an abbreviated version of the Daily Office in the morning using the [Customary of Our Lady of Walsingham][customary], which provides an opportunity to teach Scripture and theology as issues come up in the readings and feasts.\r\n\r\n## Reading\r\n\r\nAs preparation we taught sight words and letter sounds while reading books to X for about a year before he started to read.  When we were ready for formal teaching, we used Memoria Press's [First Start Reading][firstStart] together with the colored Primary Phonics readers (not published by MP but available from them).  It worked.  We didn't end up using Classical Phonics directly (which is also part of the MP curriculum) but my wife found it helpful (I have an undergrad degree in linguistics, so I didn't really need it).  After going through the phonics readers we went through a few grades of the standard books in the Memoria Press curriculum, then switched to just having him read whatever he felt like. \r\n\r\nWe used MP's spelling curriculum intermittently but haven't done much with it lately.\r\n\r\n## Spanish\r\n\r\nWe take Spanish classes from [Spanish Homeschool Academy][spanishAcademy]. Currently we do half an hour a week but will probably increase this.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n- [Worksheet Works][http://www.worksheetworks.com/] can make all sorts of worksheets for drilling math, Latin, etc.  We don't do a lot of drilling, but occassionally it's necessary.\r\n- we use [Anki][anki] for drilling. Currently X has decks for math (multiplication facts, things he learns from Life with Fred, etc.), Spanish, and Latin.  For Latin, this includes vocabulary from the MP books and both vocabulary and items derived from the marginal notes in _Lingua Latina_.  He does them for 10-20 minutes a day every day but Sunday. Y also uses Anki for English sight words and the MP kindergarten recitation facts (Anki allows you to record sound, so he doesn't need to read to use it).\r\n\r\n# Mistakes\r\nIf you are not technical at all, just e-mail me.
